vulner is a bash script that maps network devices for ports, services and will look for vulnerabilities to exploit using:

nmap, masscan, hydra, searchsploit and msfconsole.

### Possibility and Capability

> ADVANTAGES:

- will save the user general scans in a statistics file.

- check if the new supposed output file or directory is already created. (instead of :: error cant write on 'file.txt' because 'file.txt' already exist :: you'll get file.2.txt or dir.2 then .3, .4, ect...)

- check for every errors possible. (correct answers as input, if the VPN is truly active or if he failed)

- the required dependencies and libraries will be scanned and any missing packages will be installed automatically.

- use -i for info, for the script resume, type [sudo] bash  / ./vulner -i

- use -h for help, for the script usage, type [sudo] bash  / ./vulner -h

- help and info menu doesn't require sudo privileges.

> DISADVANTAGES:

- none.
