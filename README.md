remote-control is a bash script that create an anonymous environment, (using a VPN) that conduct scans on a target IP address and can access your logs securely via ssh, telnet, ftp using:

nipe, nmap, whois and curl.

### Possibility and Capability

> ADVANTAGES:

- check for every errors possible. (correct answers as input, if the VPN is truly active or if he failed)

- the required dependencies and libraries will be scanned and any missing packages will be installed automatically.

- easy to use since explanations are written. ([sudo] bash  / ./remote-control -I)

- if you need help for the script usage, type [sudo] bash  / ./remote-control -h, for more details about the options.

- help and info menu doesn't require sudo privileges.

> DISADVANTAGES:

- nipe could fail, restart manually or restart the computer connection.
